  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal PS2_CLK connected to top level port PS2_CLK has been
   removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal PS2_DAT connected to top level port PS2_DAT has been
   removed.
WARNING:Place:1137 - This design is not guaranteed to be routable! This design
   contains a global buffer instance, <clocks/clkout1_buf>, driving the net,
   <clk20>, that is driving the following (first 30) non-clock load pins.
   < PIN: orion/Mmux_a101.A2; >
   This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in
   the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable
   situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock
   loads. Please pay extra attention to the timing and routing of this path to
   ensure the design goals are met. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN
   <clocks/clkout1_buf.O> allowing your design to continue. This constraint
   disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network SD_DAT_IBUF has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 9 more times for the following

   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 173 block(s) removed
   2 block(s) optimized away
 171 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
