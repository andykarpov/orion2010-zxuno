  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Pack:2574 - The F7 multiplexer symbol
   "orion/receiver/Mmux_state[3]_state[3]_wide_mux_37_OUT_6_f7_0" and its I1
   input driver "orion/receiver/Mmux_state[3]_state[3]_wide_mux_37_OUT_711" were
   implemented suboptimally in the same slice component. The function generator
   could not be placed directly driving the F7 multiplexer. The design will
   exhibit suboptimal timing.
WARNING:Place:1137 - This design is not guaranteed to be routable! This design
   contains a global buffer instance, <clocks/clkout1_buf>, driving the net,
   <clk20>, that is driving the following (first 30) non-clock load pins.
   < PIN: orion/ram_we0_SW0.A5; >
   < PIN: orion/Mmux_a102.A5; >
   < PIN: orion/Mmux_uart_clk11.A4; >
   This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in
   the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable
   situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock
   loads. Please pay extra attention to the timing and routing of this path to
   ensure the design goals are met. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN
   <clocks/clkout1_buf.O> allowing your design to continue. This constraint
   disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net orion/hcnt<9>_inv is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   orion/csf767_dataO[3]_AND_462_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is
   not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into
   the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   orion/csf767_dataO[4]_AND_460_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is
   not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into
   the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net orion/_i000009<7> is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal
   <orion/t80inst/u0/Regs/Mram_RegsL11_RAMD_D1_O> is incomplete. The signal does
   not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal
   <orion/t80inst/u0/Regs/Mram_RegsH11_RAMD_D1_O> is incomplete. The signal does
   not drive any load pins in the design.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network orion/t80inst/u0/Regs/Mram_RegsH121/SPO has no
   load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 3 more times for the following

INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

   (.mrp).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
